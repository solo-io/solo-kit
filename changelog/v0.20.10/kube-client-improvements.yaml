      AllowUnknownFields when unmarshalling a kube spec into a resource. Previously,
      unknown fields would cause an error. This is safe, because for the spec to be persisted
      in the first place, it must respect the CRD validation schema definition.

    description: |
      Add ExpressionSelector to ListOpts and WatchOpts.
      This adds support to set-based label selection on resource clients, allowing selection
      of resources with multiple values for the same key. Previously, only equality-based
      label selection was supported, which required a single key and value for all defined requirements.
