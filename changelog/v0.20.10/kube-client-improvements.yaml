      StatusReporter can be configured with custom Write options, and by
      default is configured with a FieldManager = "status-reporter", so that

      AllowUnknownFields when unmarshalling a kube spec into a resource. Previously,
      unknown fields would cause an error. This is safe, because for the spec to be persisted
      in the first place, it must respect the CRD validation schema definition.

      Add ExpressionSelector to ListOpts and WatchOpts.
      This adds support to set-based label selection on resource clients, allowing selection
      of resources with multiple values for the same key. Previously, only equality-based
      label selection was supported, which required a single key and value for all defined requirements.
