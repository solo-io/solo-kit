  - type: BREAKING_CHANGE
    description: >-
      Adds `MakeConsistent` to `Snapshot` interface, so Gloo translation loop can always succeed. Also updates the
      `SnapshotCache` in a breaking way such that the `SetSnapshot` function can no longer error, so Gloo can ensure
      translation completes. Also updates `GetResourceReferences` to return the parent resources rather than just
      true.
