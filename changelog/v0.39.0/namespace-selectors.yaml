      Added the ability to watch namespaces given by Expression Selectors in the Watch Opts.
      Watched Namespaces work as normally. When Expression Selectors are set the snapshot
      emitter will watch, in addition to the watched namespaces, namespaces that
      are labeled and meet the criteria of the Expression Selector. All resource 
      clients will watch these namespaces, if set, via the snapshot emitters.
