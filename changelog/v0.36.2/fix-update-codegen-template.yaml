  description: >-
    Fix the hack/update-codegen.sh bash script to work with Kubernetes 1.31
    code generation. Previously, consumers were unable to run the generated
    hack/update-codegen.sh script due to an invalid "source" command. Additionally,
    the script has been adapted to run each k8s.io/code-generator binary directly
    instead of interacting with the new bash script.
