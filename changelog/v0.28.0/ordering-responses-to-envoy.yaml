      Add ordering to Response Watches so that the order sent to Envoy is in sync.
      This would cause an issue in Envoy where the ClusterAssignmentLoad would update before
      Clusters would.  This caused the Clusters to stay in a warming state until Envoy timed
      out, deleting the Endpoints on the cluster.
