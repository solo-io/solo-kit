    description: |
      Solo-Kit now supports custom Resource Types which do not require .proto definitions.
      Solo-Kit can generate clients and event loops for resources which implement the resources.Resource
      interface. Note that the resources.Resource interface has been changed to remove the proto.Message
      interface. This means that `proto.{Marshal,Unmarshal,Clone}` methods will not compile on a resources.Resource.
