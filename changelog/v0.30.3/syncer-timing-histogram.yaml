    description: >
      Add a new stat to each syncer which records the duration of each call to Sync().
      This stat will be exposed as a histogram in the Prometheus metrics. Specifically 
      under the name '<syncer_name>_sync_time_sec'. Additionally it will expose a label to 
      drill down to the individual syncers as there may be multiple. This label is 'syncer_name'.
      The syncer itself will be exposed as the type name.
